# Som-Bio-Readme

Hi! I'm Somadina Ekwe, a high school student passionate about data science, programming, and web development. Currently studying at the Newark School of Data Science and Information Technology, I'm eager to use GitHub to collaborate with other developers, manage my projects, and continuously improve my skills. Through GitHub, I aim to showcase my projects, including my Transit Track app, and contribute to the tech community.
